>Now that Bobby has proven his SQL chops, his manager has given both of you two more assignments: determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. Then, you’ll write a report that summarizes your analysis and helps prepare Bobby’s manager for the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach retirement age.
